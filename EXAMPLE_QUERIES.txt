NOTES
================================================================================

- The agent will automatically chain functions when booking appointments:
  1. Search for patient (if name provided)
  2. Find available slots
  3. Book appointment using first available slot

- Insurance checks will automatically map patient names to IDs without searching first

- Appointment searches will NOT trigger patient searches (only shows available slots)

- All queries are case-insensitive

- You can use partial names (e.g., "Ravi" instead of "Ravi Kumar")
